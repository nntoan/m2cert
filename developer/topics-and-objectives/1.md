# Topics and Objectives - Part 1

## **1** Magento Architecture and Customization Techniques

[Back to Index](./) | [Next Section](./2.md)

------


## **1.1** Describe Magento's module-based architecture

**Describe module limitations.** 


**Q.** How do different modules interact with each other? 

> Modules interact with each other using Dependency injection (di.xml) and layout files (/view/frontend/layout, /view/adminhtml/layout). They can also depend on other modules if they use their logic.


**Q.** What side-effects can come from this interaction?

> If modules use Dependency injection, they can load in the wrong order or try to redefine the already redefined functionality of the module. To solve this problem, you should use sequence in module.xml.
> 
> If the modules use other modules’ logic and the module, whose logic is used, is disabled, dependencies will not be used and an error will occur when executing the code.

## **1.2** Describe Magento's directory structure

**Determine how to locate different types of files in Magento.** 

**Q.** Where are the files containing JavaScript, HTML, and PHP located?

**Q.** How do you find the files responsible for certain functionality?

**_References:_**


## **1.3** Utilize configuration XML and variables scope

**Determine how to use configuration files in Magento.** 

**Q.** Which configuration files correspond to different features and functionality?

**_References:_**


## **1.4** Demonstrate how to use dependency injection

**Describe Magento's dependency injection approach and architecture.** 

**Q.** How are objects realized in Magento? Why is it important to have a centralized process creating object instances?

**Identify how to use DI configuration files for customizing Magento.** 

**Q.** How can you override a native class, inject your class into another object, and use other techniques available in `di.xml` (such as `virtualTypes`)?

## **1.5** Demonstrate ability to use plugins

**Demonstrate how to design complex solutions using the plugin's life cycle.** 

**Q.** How do multiple plugins interact, and how can their execution order be controlled?

> Magento calls these Plugins (interceptors) sequentially according to a configured **sort order**, so they do not conflict with one another.

> **[Plugin Prioritization](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/extension-dev-guide/plugins.html#prioritizing-plugins)**
>
> The `sortOrder` property for plugins determine when their `before`, `after`, or `around` methods get called when more than one plugins are observing the same method.
>
> **The prioritization rules for ordering plugins:**
>
> * Before the execution of the observed method, Magento will execute plugins from **lowest to greatest `sortOrder`**.
>   * During each plugin execution, Magento executes the current plugin’s before method.
>   * After the before plugin completes execution, the current plugin’s around method will wrap and execute the next plugin or observed method.
>
> * Following the execution of the observed method, Magento will execute plugins from **greatest to lowest `sortOrder`**.
>   * During each plugin execution, the current plugin will first finish executing its around method.
>   * When the around method completes, the plugin executes its after method before moving on to the next plugin.
  
**Q.** How do you debug a plugin if it doesn't work?

**Identify strengths and weaknesses of plugins.** 

**Q.** What are the limitations of using plugins for customization? 

> **[Limitations](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/extension-dev-guide/plugins.html#limitations)**
>
> * **Plugins can _NOT_ be used on following:**
>   * Final methods
>   * Final classes
>   * Non-public methods
>   * Class methods (such as static methods)
>   * `__construct`
>   * Virtual types
>   * Objects that are instantiated before `Magento\Framework\Interception` is bootstrapped

**Q.** In which cases should plugins be avoided?

> **[Using Around Plugins](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/ext-best-practices/extension-coding/common-programming-bp.html#using-around-plugins)**
>
> **Avoid using around method plugins when they are not required because they increase stack traces and affect performance.**
>
> **The only use case for around method plugins** is when the execution of all further plugins and original methods need termination.
>
> Use **after method plugins** if you require arguments for replacing or altering function results.

## **1.6** Configure event observers and scheduled jobs

**Demonstrate how to configure observers.** 

**Q.** How do you make your observer only be active on the frontend or backend?

> **[Event Areas]()**
>
> Generally, the location of the `events.xml` file will be under the `<module-root>/etc` directory. Observers that are associated with events here will watch for these events globally. 
>
> The events.xml file can also be defined under the `<module-root>/etc/frontend` and `<module-root>/etc/adminhtml` directories to configure observers to only watch for events in those specific areas.

**Demonstrate how to configure a scheduled job.** 

**Q.** Which parameters are used in configuration, and how can configuration interact with server configuration?

**Identify the function and proper use of automatically available events,**

**Q.** For example `*_load_after`, etc.

## **1.7** Utilize the CLI

**Describe the usage of `bin/magento` commands in the development cycle.**  

**Q.** Which commands are available? 

> **[Command Summary](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands.html#config-cli-summary)**
>


**Q.** How are commands used in the development cycle?

**Demonstrate an ability to create a deployment process.** 

**Q.** How does the application behave in different deployment modes, and how do these behaviors impact the deployment approach for PHP code, frontend assets, etc.?

## **1.8** Demonstrate the ability to manage the cache

**Describe cache types and the tools used to manage caches.**
 
**Q.**  How do you add dynamic content to pages served from the full page cache?

**Describe how to operate with cache clearing.**
 
**Q.** How would you clean the cache? 

**Q.** In which case would you refresh cache/flash cache storage?

**Describe how to clear the cache programmatically.** 

**Q.** What mechanisms are available for clearing all or part of the cache?
